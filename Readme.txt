This AddIn compares the source code in the VB IDE with the source code that was last saved and shows the differences. If you have been working on a piece of code for a while you can probably not remember all you have done. One click - and this AddIn will tell you.

Alterations to the form or to controls in that form are also shown. 
Known quirk: For no evident reason VB seems to alter .frx files occasionally, so the AddIn may show changes in connection with this where in fact there are none.

The comparison is not line number dependent but is controlled by content only. Unaltered lines are shown in black, new lines in red, deleted lines are blue and striken out, and finally changed lines are shown as deleted and new.

Empty lines which you might have inserted or deleted are not shown - this is because I found it rather difficult to strike out nothing *g*
